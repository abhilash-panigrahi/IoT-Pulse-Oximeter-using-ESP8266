IoT Pulse Oximeter using ESP8266

An IoT-based pulse oximeter built with ESP8266 (NodeMCU) and MAX30102 to measure SpO₂, heart rate, and respiration rate from PPG signals.
Features OLED display, Blynk IoT real-time monitoring, and machine learning–based analysis using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with advanced PPG feature extraction.
Includes Arduino firmware, required libraries, and a Python notebook for PPG ML analysis and validation.
